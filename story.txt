The washerman had received a new load from one of the richest families in town.
He had two animals to help him, an agile horse and an equally tired donkey.
He had to this load to the river to wash it. 
He put the entire load on the donkey pushing him to a state of extreme lightheadedness due to the large weight.
The donkey asked the horse for help, but instead of helping him the horse started mocking him about how his owner prefers him more compared to the silly donkey.
